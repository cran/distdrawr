Thanks a lot for using distdrawr. Please feel free to contact me any time with comments or suggestions concerning the package (<nico.friess@posteo.de>). The purpose of the package is simply to offer a quick tool to access distribution data from vascular plants stored in the FLORKART-database (maintained by the Federal Agency of Nature Conservation of Germany and the Network Phytodiversity in Germany NetPhyD). In the FLORKART-database you can openly access information on the distribution of plants in Germany. Since this is only possible for single species in an unconvenient way, I decided to build a package offering simple functions to access the data for a whole species list at a time. Furthermore you can quickly assess whether the species under study have entries in the FLORKART-database. I am open to ideas for other features that would facilitate the workflow with this database, so feel free to contact me with ideas. Best regards, N.
